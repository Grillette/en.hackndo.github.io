BloodHound is a tool for visualizing an Active Directory environment as a graph. This representation then offers all the power of graph theory to unravel new attack paths that otherwise would have been difficult or impossible to detect.

## Active Directory

In an Active Directory environment, access rights management is complex, very complex. It is not uncommon for a user to be part of a group, which is part of 10 other groups, and that one of these groups has the right to modify a GPO which applies to an organizational unit that contains users with administrative rights on a set of hosts. That could go forever.

The issue is that as the administrator of a complex information system these delegations of access rights are extremely complex to detect. Administrators usually look at some access lists that a user or a group has on a particular object. Sometimes there are dozens of different rights that can be applied to an object.

Here is an example of a list of ACE (Access Control Entry) that can be found on a "GPO" object.

[![ACL Complexity](../assets/uploads/2019/07/acl_complexity.png)](../assets/uploads/2019/07/acl_complexity.png)

The scroll bar on the right shows that there is a very large number of possible entries. Think about the fact that there are entries like these on all objects in the Active Directory, that some of these rights can be applied via delegation, that there are groups included in other groups, inheriting their parent groups rights and so on.

This is the issue [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) is trying to solve. When working with lists is a nightmare, working with graphs is way more effective.

## BloodHound

Bloodhound is a tool developped by [@wald0](https://twitter.com/_wald0), [@Harmj0y](https://twitter.com/harmj0y) and [@CptJesus](https://twitter.com/cptjesus). The idea of this tool is to analyze an Active Directory environment by enumerating its various objects, and by linking them with some relationships. For example, if the user `support-account` is a member of a group called `support`, the user will be linked with the relationship `MemberOf` to this particuliar group.

[![MemberOf](/assets/uploads/2019/07/MemberOf.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/MemberOf.png)

It's quite easy to visualize this kind of relationship. Something is **MemberOf** something else, but it doesn't stop there. It also lets you visualize that `support` group is member of `domain admins` group, which means that `support-account` is also member of `domain admins` group.

[![memberOfNested](/assets/uploads/2019/07/memberOfNested.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/memberOfNested.png)

That's not it ! If we ask to display all the groups that `support-account` is member of, we realize that there where a lot more !

[![MemberOfDelegated](/assets/uploads/2019/07/MemberOfDelegated.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/MemberOfDelegated.png)

And that's only the `MemberOf` relationship. There are plenty of others. To this day, here is the list of all available relationships.

[![edges](/assets/uploads/2019/07/edges.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/edges.png)

Ok, so now we have a set of objects linked together with relationships. Now it's possible to find some attack paths using graph theory.

But wait. What is graph theory ?

## Graph theory

[Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)  is based on a "graph" representation of the data. It is made up of nodes (here the objects in Active Directory) and edges (here the relations between the objects). 

[![graphe_example](/assets/uploads/2019/07/graphe_example.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/graphe_example.png)

In graph theory, edges can be directed which is the case of BloodHound. This means that to go from node A to node B, they must be connected by an edge going **from** A **to** B. The other way does not work.

[![oriented_edge](/assets/uploads/2019/07/oriented_edge.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/oriented_edge.png)

Once we have all these nodes connected by edges, we can look for particular paths to start from a node and arrive at a destination node, passing through a whole set of other nodes. There are often several possible paths, and graph theory makes it possible to find the shortest paths to connect two particular objects.

The following graph consists of 7 nodes and 9 edges.

[![graphe_before](/assets/uploads/2019/07/graphe_before.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/graphe_before.png)

If we managed to take control of the leftmost node, and we wish to reach the rightmost node, because it is the `Domain admins` node, graph theory allows us to find the shortest path between these two.

[![graphe_after](/assets/uploads/2019/07/graphe_after.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/graphe_after.png)

An attacker with this information will know how to move through the network to reach his objective in a minimum number of steps.

Take for example a real Active Directory environment. It is made up of a large number of nodes.

[![All nodes](/assets/uploads/2019/07/all_nodes.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/all_nodes.png)

If we compromise `jdoe` user, this is the shortest path to reach `domain admins` group.

[![ad_shortest_path](/assets/uploads/2019/07/ad_shortest_path.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/ad_shortest_path.png)

As we can see, the "shortest" path is quite long, which suggests the environement is quite complexe. Despite this complexity, using BloodHound allows to simply and clearly extract an attack path from a user who didn't seem to have any special access rights.

In order to be able to use graph theory, BloodHound uses "Neo4j" graph oriented database to store Active Directory data.

## How does it work ?

The BloodHound tool manipulates diffrent data types, collected by different techniques.

First, in order to collect directory data, it is necessary to request it from a domain controller. If we have a domain account, even if it has no particular rights, we can browse by default all the users, hosts, GPOs, ACLs, and other information in this directory.

Furthermore, until recently, it was possible to ask the various host for the list of their local groups, which made it possible to know who was local administrator of which host by correlating this information with the membership of the users in the different groups.

Then we are able to enumerate the remote sessions on the hosts using the command line `net session \\computer`. This is an output example:

```
net session \\computer

Computer      User name                Client type  Opens   Idle time
---------------------------------------------------------------------
\\SOURCE      SUPPORT-ACCOUNT          Windows 7    1       00:00:13
```

This command lets you know that the user `SUPPORT-ACCOUNT` requested a resource on `computer` from the host `SOURCE`. This information confirms that `SUPPORT-ACCOUNT` currently has an active session on `SOURCE`. This is important information since it indicates that the credentials of `support-account` should be in **lsass** memory on `SOURCE`.

These different information (not exhaustive) are collected with [SharpHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound) ingestor, and are saved in a `json` format in different files.

[![list_files](/assets/uploads/2019/07/list_files.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/list_files.png)

These files are then imported into BloodHound which stores them in the Neo4j database. Once the import is complete, the BloodHound graphical interface allows you to quickly visualize this data via built-in or custom cypher queries.

[![prebuilt_queries](/assets/uploads/2019/07/prebuilt_queries.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/prebuilt_queries.png)

It is also possible to send requests directly into the Neo4j interface, which can be useful for extracting data in table format.

[![neo4j_interface](/assets/uploads/2019/07/neo4j_interface.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/neo4j_interface.png)

## Requests

Beyond the built-in requests proposed by BloodHound, it is possible to write your own requests. I'm not going to write a tutorial about this here: [CptJesus](https://twitter.com/cptjesus) wrote [BloodHound: Intro to Cypher](https://blog.cptjesus.com/posts/introtocypher) which describes in detail how it works.


You can also go read the paper from [SadProcessor](https://twitter.com/SadProcessor) called [The Dog Whisperer's Handbook](https://www.ernw.de/download/BloodHoundWorkshop/ERNW_DogWhispererHandbook.pdf) that talks about BloodHound and introduces the cypher query language.

However you should know that it is possible to activate the "debug" mode in BloodHound that displays the raw cypher queries executed when you click on a button in the graphical interface.

[![debug_mode](/assets/uploads/2019/07/debug_mode.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/debug_mode.png)

This query can then be used in Neo4J if needed.

For lazy people that didn't read the posts I linked above, here's a quick overview of a cypher query.

```
MATCH p=(n:User {name:"SUPPORT-ACCOUNT@ADSEC.LOCAL"})-[r:MemberOf*1..]->(g:Group) RETURN p
```

This query lists all the groups user `support-account` is member of. This query can be splitted in two.

The first part `MATCH` indicates what we are looking for. What we find between parentheses indicates the nodes, and between square brackets the relationship.

We are therefore looking for a node `n` of type` User` having a relationship `r` of type` MemberOf` to a node `g` of type` Group`. The content between curly braces allows you to apply a filter, here a filter on the name `SUPPORT-ACCOUNT@ADSEC.LOCAL`.

In the relationship part between square brackets, we indicate that this relation must be present one or more times (`* 1..`).

The second part `RETURN` indicates what we want to return. Here, we want to return the whole relationship assigned to the `p` variable.

[![query_result](/assets/uploads/2019/07/query_result.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/query_result.png)

We could have decided to only list the different groups without displaying the relationships or the users. We just need to return the `g` nodes.

[![query_result_g](/assets/uploads/2019/07/query_result_g.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/query_result_g.png)

For more complexe queries, the posts I linked before will help you go deeper.

## Tips & tricks

Here is a list of some little tips or information that may be important or useful.

### Dark mode

The first, and by far the most important, is the dark mode of the graphical interface!

[![dark_mode](/assets/uploads/2019/07/dark_mode.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/dark_mode.png)

This mode allows you to have a dark and classy interface, which is super nice. That's it, it's beautiful, but that's it.

### Right click on edges

When there is a relationship between two nodes, you can "right click" the relationship and a pop-up will display a lot of extremely useful information.

You do not know how to use the `GenericAll` link?

[![genericall_link](/assets/uploads/2019/07/genericall_link.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/genericall_link.png)

No problem, right clicking the edge will display the tooltip.

[![help_modal](/assets/uploads/2019/07/help_modal.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/help_modal.png)

It contains all the necessary information to take control of the destination host.

### Owned

During the progress of your penetration test, you will compromise hosts, users, groups. You can mark the objects as "owned" after a right click on them to keep track of your progression.

[![owned](/assets/uploads/2019/07/owned.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/owned.png)

A skull icon will mark these objects afterwards.

[![owned_object](/assets/uploads/2019/07/owned_object.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/owned_object.png)

If you are trying to compromise a particular node, you can now request the shortest attack path from the nodes you have already compromized. Neat.

[![shortestpath_owned](/assets/uploads/2019/07/shortestpath_owned.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/shortestpath_owned.png)

### Filters

If you do not want to display certain paths because there are relationships that you cannot exploit, or because you do not have the time, or any other reasons, you can decide to uncheck the relationships you do not want to use so that they no longer appear in your queries. To do this, simply click on the filter button to the right of the search bar, and check or uncheck the edges that you want.

[![Edge Filtering](/assets/uploads/2019/07/edge_filtering.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/edge_filtering.png)

### Shortcuts

There are a few shortcuts that can be useful when using BloodHound. If you know others, don't hesitate to share them.

* **CTRL**: Allows you to display or hide node and relationship labels.
* **CTRL + SHIFT + I**: Displays the developer tools. If you have a bug in the interface, the javascript console will often allow you to understand the root cause of the issue.
* **CTRL + R**: Reloads the display
* **SPACE**: Pops up a table that list all currently displayed nodes. That's very convinient if you want to export some queries result into Excel or something.

### Editing

During the data collection, your computer was part of the collected hosts and you do not want to see it? You have logged on to a machine, but the "HasSession" link of the domain administrator is no longer effective since this machine has restarted? On the contrary, another user is connected on this machine?

Once the data has been imported into BloodHound, it is not frozen. You can modify them as you wish, either by right-clicking on an object or relationship to delete it, or by right-clicking in the background to add a node or relationship.

[![Add edge](/assets/uploads/2019/07/add_edge.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/add_edge.png)

### Notes & Screenshots

You can also save information on objects in the Active Directory by left clicking on them and going to the "Notes" section in the BloodHound interface.

[![notes_pictures](/assets/uploads/2019/07/notes_pictures.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/notes_pictures.png)

### BloodHound Analytics

Finally, the same team that developed BloodHound also released some tools to create statistics out of a BloodHound extraction. They are available on [their Github](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound-Tools/), including the `bloodhoundanalytics.pbix` template that uses Microsoft free software `PowerBI`.

Here is an example taken from [Wald0 tweet](https://twitter.com/_wald0/status/1139672785389703168), which shows a PowerBI dashboard using the template provided on the Github.

[![PowerBI](/assets/uploads/2019/07/PowerBi_result.png)](/assets/uploads/2019/07/PowerBi_result.png)

The result is superb and very explicit for management.

## Going further

A [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxd2rerVsLo) was made at BSides by the three authors in 2016 to introduce BloodHound.

The authors of the tool are also present on the dedicated [Slack server](http://bloodhoundhq.slack.com/). There is a large community present on this Slack ready to welcome you and answer your questions. There is even a #french channel!

BloodHound is not the only tool of its kind. We have a Franco-French tool called [AD Control Paths](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/AD-control-paths) developed by ANSSI. A [talk](https://www.sstic.org/2014/presentation/chemins_de_controle_active_directory/) was made during the SSTIC on this subject and the associated PDF is very interesting. French readers, you should read it.

## Conclusion

As long as the defense teams think in list and the attackers think in graph, attackers will be one step ahead. This is why **BloodHound** can also be used as a defense tool. Collect data on a regular basis and prepare some queries to check your Active Directory health/security and monitor its evolution.

To conclude, BloodHound offers a new approach to visualize data in Active Directory environments. Graph visualization makes it possible to understand the complex relationships and intricacies of objects and relationships in the information system in order to identify attack paths and/or abnormal behavior.
